# 📚 Library Management System (Console-Based Java Project)
✅ Project Overview
This is a simple Library Management System built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.

The system allows users to:

View available books 📖

Borrow books 📝

Return borrowed books ✅

It runs entirely through the console, making it beginner-friendly for understanding OOPS principles and basic data structures in Java.


✅ Features

📌 View Books — Displays all books with their status (Available / Borrowed)

📌 Borrow Book — Borrow a book by entering its title

📌 Return Book — Return a borrowed book by entering its title

🧹 Simple and clean console interface

✅ OOPS Concepts Used

✅ Encapsulation — Book class fields are private with getters and methods

✅ Abstraction — Library class hides internal logic from the main program

✅ Class Interaction — Main class interacts with Library class to manage books

✅ Technologies Used

🟣 Java

🟢 ArrayList Data Structure

🔵 Scanner (for console input)
